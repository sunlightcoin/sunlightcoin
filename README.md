The SunlightChain Manifesto 
 
The application of blockchain technology will subvert the economic model that is over-dependent on the center, and its inherent characteristics of openness, sharing, and decentralization will greatly improve efficiency and promote a huge jump in social productivity! This is unimaginable in a society dominated by the traditional economy, but it will become a reality in an information society dominated by the knowledge economy and intangible assets. 
 
The future is here, let us stand at the forefront of new technologies, embrace great changes, meet the opportunities coming our way, and use our technology to serve the society and the people. 
 
The great Adam Smith, the chief founder of economics, once said: "The natural effort of every man to change his condition, when freely and safely exercised, is a very powerful principle, that this individual effort, by no other means, can bring wealth and prosperity to society." 
 
This is the Industrial Revolution Adam Smith on behalf of small business to the monopoly with franchise issued a cry, without such ideas and actions to support countless small businesses, the development of the industrial Revolution would not have reached the present degree. 
 
History is always in a spiral, and it is time for humanity to unleash its collective potential like a volcano! Blockchain technology greatly implements this great idea by promoting "the freedom and security of individual exercise," making the economy no longer just a game for the few. 
 
Technology should not be exalted, but rooted. Blockchain products such as digital currencies will become the engine leading the information society. A new era is coming! SunlightChain team with years of knowledge accumulation and research and development skills to meet this wave, full of confidence, but also walking on thin ice! We believe in the future!
